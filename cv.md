## About me
For some years now I've been working in consulting and developing 1C:Enterprise solutions for accounting and manufacturing. 
But I've always been interested in web-development because this field has enormous possibilities for advancing and is always challenging.
I've learned basics in HTML/SCC and continuing with JavaScript, frameworks and other related themes.
I've also began to study Python but decided to postpone it a bit.

## Skills
* HTML and CSS
* Python (Basic)
* Git, GitHub
* VSCode, PyCharm community

## Code example:
###Task
*If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.*

### Solution

```Python
def solution(number):
    if number<0:
        return 0
    else:
        sum = 0;
        for count in range(number):
            if count%3==0 or count%5==0:
                sum+=count
        return sum
```
